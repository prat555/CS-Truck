# Email Configuration Instructions

## Current Status
Your email system is now set up but not configured with real email credentials. Here's what happens:

1. **Mock Mode (Current)**: Emails are logged to console only
2. **Real Email Mode**: Requires email configuration

## To Enable Real Email Sending

### Option 1: Gmail Setup (Recommended)
1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate password for "Mail"
3. **Update `.env` file**:
   ```
   EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password
   EMAIL_FROM=CS-Truck <your-email@gmail.com>
   ```

### Option 2: Other Email Services
- **Outlook**: Set `EMAIL_SERVICE=outlook`
- **Yahoo**: Set `EMAIL_SERVICE=yahoo`
- **Custom SMTP**: Modify server/emailService.ts

## How to Test Email Functionality

1. **Place a test order** in your app
2. **Check the browser console** - you'll see email logs
3. **Check the server terminal** - email status will be shown

4. If configured: Real email sent → 
5. If not configured: Console log with full email content
